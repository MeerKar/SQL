# SQL

# Background

 In this particular task is to do a research project about people whom the company Pewlett Hackard (a fictional comapny) employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, 
and then answer questions about the data through data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

To begin with have created a  local Git repository, with a folder name "EmployeeSQL".
